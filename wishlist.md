# Things I could have done better
- I would have liked to source this out of your doc repo and built your doc site, but I couldn't get it build on any of the free website builders.
- The gifs are low quality - I need to find a higher quality screen recording tool (I just used QuickTime Player)
- I'd like to build up a list of fake email accounts that I have access to so that I can more robustly test my example conditions and operators to make sure they work exactly like I'm describing them - and also work closely with usage analytics, customer support and UX to figure out really useful custom conditions.
